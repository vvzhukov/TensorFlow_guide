# TensorFlow 2.15 recap guide
# Based on official guide from Google with extra comments
# https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit

# The most common ways to prevent overfitting in neural networks:
# - More training data
# - Reduce the capacity of the network
# - Weight regularization
# - Dropout

# - Data augmentation [not covered here]
# - Batch normalization [not covered here]
